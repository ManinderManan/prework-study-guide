# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A study guide of the prework that was completed before our Full Stack bootcamp begins. We covered HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It helped created a foundation of the basics that will be used on a regular basis in the course. For somebody with little to no background with the previously mentioned topic, it is a great tool to learn about the basics of web development.

## Usage

The HTML portion of the prework study guide can help exalain the basics of how to structure a HTML document in an application such as VS code. The CSS portion helps add style to the overall HTML files with the ability to change things such as font, borders, and colors. Git allows us to link all of our work to a single branch once our changes are done. It makes collaboration a much easier task overall. JavaScript helps a computer execute code within a script. It allows the website to the interactive through the addition of different containers which allow us to store data in our code. The script also allows us to access the DevTools console to see the JavaScript running in real time.
